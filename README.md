# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
A real-time, contactless attendance management system using Deep Learning and Computer Vision. The application detects faces using YOLOv8, recognizes individuals using a fine-tuned ResNet18 model, and records attendance automatically through a Streamlit web interface.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using YOLOv8

Face recognition using ResNet18 (Transfer Learning)

Automated dataset creation via webcam (50 images per student)

Duplicate-free daily attendance marking

Confidence-based recognition (threshold > 80%)

Attendance stored and exportable as CSV

Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit UI

CPU & GPU compatible (CUDA supported)
